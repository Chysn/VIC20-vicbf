Playing Truttle1's RPG Demo
-------------------------------

Truttle1's video, "Making a Simple Game in Brainf**k!" 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg98wh2-lOw), shows the development of a role-playing
game in Brainfuck. I used this game to test VICBF, and it's included in the
files here.

The program itself is over 9K, and so it requires a VIC-20 with at least 8K
of memory expansion.

Note that PETASCII's upper and lowercase letters are the opposite of standard ASCII,
so the display will look a bit strange.
